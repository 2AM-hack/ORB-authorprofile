# ORB-authorprofile

This repository is related to the Altmetrics Hackaton. 

It tries to make an actionable mockup for an Author Profile using OpenResearcherBadges.org

OpenResearcherBadges provide a way for researchers to express whith what kind of activity they contributed to Research output.

The badges are linked to the ORCID profile of the contributor.

We followed some examples from the [Mozilla Science Blog](https://www.mozillascience.org/contributorship-badges-for-science-view-them-now)

Journals using badges from submission to publication:

- http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.ad/metrics/#author-contributions
- http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/3/1/18/about#open-badges

The same badges can be viewed at ORCID (scroll to works and expand the title)
